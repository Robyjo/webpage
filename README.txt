
For this assignment I spread my time across a bit more and took advantage of some resources I found. I 
used Visual Studio to help me with the process and found that it saved a lot of time. I also found some 
pieces and used Cloudflare.

I found on W3 schools – Fonts Awesome 5
https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome5_intro.asp

Font 5 is used for clipart, and I originally wanted a menu button, I couldn’t seem to get it to work and 
with research I came across cloud flare.
Then I was able to create the paint brush, the arrow to scroll up and the fas fa-chart-line.
I also used google fonts. Here I was able to play with the different fonts and then add them to the css 
style sheet. Google has an option to use @import in the css file.
@import 
url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Ubuntu:
wght@400;500;700&display=swap')

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu?query=ubuntu#standard-styles
I also really wanted to find a way to get things to be side by side and found that there are lots of options. 
I ended up picking the Owl Carousel to get things to move with left to right - 
https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/
Cloudflare helped me with ideas, and I used them as a resource with a lot of the coding 
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/.

I really wanted to get my portfolio started is why I choose to build this website. While in class I figured I 
can start to make use of the projects I am doing. I really wanted good pictures and might have to go in 
and get some professional ones. For the time being I made the shell and used the Muppets as my 
references. I am Kermit on Discord, so I used him as my self as well. 

This took me about 4 days to finish and I was in between other assignments and work, so I threw out a 
number of roughly 10 hours on the project. I learned a lot with this class and what all I can do within a 
website. In the end I didn’t have much time for REACT, so I threw a little piece in on the time with that.
The assignment instructions were confusing to me, so I made use of what I learned in the class so far. 
Seeing the progress from puff assignment 1 to 6 really shows a difference! thanks.
